## matching.py

One night project to create a clean commandline interface for this cup matching game online that I got into.

Gemini assistance took care of most of the boilerplate and error handling code, though it did at one point included the solution in the example while prompting for user input. But overall, I had to do very little modification for the game to be playable, only some adjustments for my display preference. Ended up playing, ahem, testing, this until 1:30am...
